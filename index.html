        <p>I created a snap project with a variety of different variables to make a series or squares in a certain perspective. Our goal was to just make a block to draw a square and to be able to change the side length very easily and we did it by making loops but I decided to take it a step further and I wanted to make random sized squares. The challenging part was putting it into perspective but I figured out that if you do a little math to distance the square based on its random side length you could then have the random square make themself into perspective.

        <p>In this game we learned how to actually code a game with interacting variables. The most challenging part was just that, to have our different sprites and backgrounds interact with one another's movements and to change bases on what you did as a player. The controls were easy but changing scenes and having moving obstacles was harder to make more solid. We used a lot of “if touching this color” blocks to activate most of our variables. It brought a lot of insight to us through making it though, the logic we practiced in making it was super helpful to what we are learning now.

        <p>This is our congressional app challenge app that we submitted to the challenge. The challenge was to creat an app that benifits people and we submitted it to congress. Out game was a carbon counter where you went through your day and it sould show you the effects your daily choices would have on your carbon out put. We used a series of list to hold our elemetns and various visuals to make this game appealing. In the end we won this app challege for our distric and were going to visit washington D.C.
