    <p>I have always loved making things espesially when you can see the projects that you work on come into fruition. When I started working on all these projects it really inpired me to keep creating and inspire others to creat as well.

      <h3>Claw Machine</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Robotics Club Project</p>
      <p>The claw machine was a project done by me and two other students. When we recived the claw it was just a skeleton for which the machine was to be build off of, me and the two other students Aaron Tullino and Ian Flores finnished it.This included all of the electronics and wireing, the laser cutting of the pannels, coding, even adding features like a coin slot and lights.</p>

      <p class="w3-opacity">Scratch Game</p>
      <p>different sprites and backgrounds interact with one another's movements and to change bases on what you did as a player. The controls were easy but changing scenes and having moving obstacles was harder to make more solid. We used a lot of “if touching this color” blocks to activate most of our variables. It brought a lot of insight to us through making it though, the logic we practiced in making it was super helpful to what we are learning now. </p>

      <h3>Carbon Counter</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Congressional App</p>
      <p>This is our congressional app challenge app that we submitted to the challenge. The challenge was to creat an app that benifits people and we submitted it to congress. Out game was a carbon counter where you went through your day and it sould show you the effects your daily choices would have on your carbon out put. We used a series of list to hold our elemetns and various visuals to make this game appealing. In the end we won this app challege for our distric and were going to visit washington D.C.</p>

      <h3>Rainbow Square</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Snap App</p>
      <p>I created a snap project with a variety of different variables to make a series or squares in a certain perspective. Our goal was to just make a block to draw a square and to be able to change the side length very easily and we did it by making loops but I decided to take it a step further and I wanted to make random sized squares. The challenging part was putting it into perspective but I figured out that if you do a little math to distance the square based on its random side length you could then have the random square make themself into perspective.</p>
